    - name: Data Prediction and Interpolation
      link: 
      details: |
        - Analysed raw data from ManyLab’s project, to predict missing data and extract significant features.
        - Implemented one-hot encoding & normalization on raw data and programmed Bayesian Network tree using Chow-Liu algorithm for feature dependency interference and data interpolation. Predicted satisfactorily(near 67%) of missing data while eliminating irrelevant features present in data.

    - name: Data Analysis and Price Prediction of Airbnb Listings
      link:
      details: |
        - Exploratory data analysis on Airbnb listings in NYC, to detect hidden trends and patterns.
        - Applied Linear Regression, Random Forest & Xtreme Gradient Boosting, with cross validation and feature engineering for parameter tuning, resulted in improved Price prediction accuracy with minimized RMSE.

    - name: Colorizer for Black & White Image
      link:
      details: |
        - Modeled a linear regression based learning model in python for converting black and white images to color using training on color and black/white duals of images without semantic classification of objects.
        - Used stochastic gradient descent optimization to minimize MSE objective function & studied factors beneficial to model performance in learning conditions limited to non-contextual & localized features.

    - name: Quantum Error Correcting Codes
      link:
      details: |
        - Studied techniques used in quantum computers and circuits for error correction and fault tolerance.
        - Implemented the bit flip and phase flip quantum error correcting code, using IBM’s Qiskit services on IBM’s 5 qubit quantum computer.
